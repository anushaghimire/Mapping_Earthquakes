# Overview 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes and tectonic plates all over the world for the last seven days. Also to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

 To complete this project, I used an URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then added the data to a map. For the tectonic plates I used the GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json data from a github repository.

**Languages Used:**
- JavaScript
- css
- html
- D3.js
- index.html
- leaflet
- mapbox API

## Results 
The image shows the earthquakes from the last seven days all over the world. When we click on one on those circles we can see the magnitude and location of earthquake.
